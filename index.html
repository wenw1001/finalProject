Some male youths greet him in a large grassy area, called the "Glade," enclosed by tall stone walls. The boys, the "Gladers," have formed a rudimentary society, and each assumes specialized tasks. Their leader, Alby, says that every boy eventually recalls his name but not his past. The boy learns that a vast Maze surrounding them is the only way out.

              Years later, shortly after being rescued from the Maze, Thomas and the remaining Gladers (Teresa, Newt, Minho, Frypan, and Winston) are taken to a facility run by Mr. Janson. He says that the facility is a safe haven protecting them from WCKD, the Flare virus, and the "Cranks" and provides them supplies.
